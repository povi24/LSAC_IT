For testing, you first have to clone the repo and then install the npm dependencies "$ npm install"
Now, in the project directory, you can run "$ npm start".
Some links that i found useful for this part were - https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-test-a-local-react-npm-package-still-on-development9bed7f199164
                                                  - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
                                                  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-react-project-with-create-react-app


The hierarchy will look something like this:

.src
  |___assets(here are all the pictures that are used)
  |
  |___components(here i implemented the NavBar)
  |
  |___parts(here are other parts of the page such as the Footer, the MostViewed section etc)
  |
  |___styles(here are the css files)


In App.js are all the components and parts of the page ordered as they appear on the page.

    It was the first time I created an application using React and CSS (these being used on the advice 
of my mentor). Until now I have not had any contact with web technologies and that is why I really 
tried to do as much as possible of the tasks (I can't say that it is a great success, but at least
I tried :) )

    I can say that I understood quite quickly (a few days of research) how things work, how to use CSS,
what it means and how to make a page responsive, and I really liked working on the frontend.

    Google, Youtube and Johnny were my best friends during the days when I was learning and coding and
for sure (although the deadline has already passed) I will continue to work and I would really like to 
finish the frontend part on winter break .


    Since I started with 0 knowledge, I can't say that I learned very well all the concepts that I used,
but I left below a list of links that helped me a lot and from where I best understood the explanations
( maybe they'll be on the list of resources next year and help other newbies like me :) )
